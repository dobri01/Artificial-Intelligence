# Infinitesimal
In mathematics, an **infinitesimal** or **infinitesimal number** is a quantity that is closer to zero than any standard real number, but that is not zero.
# Probability Density Function - PDF
In probability theory, a **probability density function**, or **density** of a [[Probability#Continuous Random Variables| continuous random variable]], is a function whose value at any given point in the [[Probability#Sample Space|sample space]] can be interpreted as *providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be close to that sample.*

Since the _absolute likelihood_ for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.

==The PDF is used to specify the probability of the [[Probability#Random variables|random variable]] falling _within a particular range of values_, as opposed to taking on any one value.==

# Differentiable
A differentiable function of one real variable is a function whose [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) exists at each point in its domain.
The graph of a differentiable function has a non-vertical tangent line at each interior point in its domain and does not contain any break, angle or [cusp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity) "Cusp (singularity)").
