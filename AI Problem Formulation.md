Consider that a cancer hospital intents to develop an AI solution for the automatic prediction of cancer from the MRI of a patient's brain.

- problem formulation - data and labelling needs 
- identification of relevant deep neural network (that can be used for solution development - just the name)
- the learning and training process of such network (how weights will be updated)
- performance evaluation
